## Features

- **AutoClick BigCookie** - option to adjust click speed from 50ms to 3,000ms (1000ms = 1second)
- **AutoClick Special** (Shimmers) - Golden cookie, Reindeer, Wrath. This can now be customized further in the options menu.
- **AutoClick BigCookie** - during frenzy/click frenzy.
- **AutoBuy** - Buy "best CPS" buildings and upgrades (excluding **Vaulted**) automatically. You can also "Vault" (exclude) Tech upgrades and buildings so AutoBuy does not buy them through the options menu. "Chocolate Egg" although considered an upgrade you can Vault once you unlock Inspired Checklist, I manually added it in the mod Options menu to exclude from AutoBuy.

  It does not just "buy" buildings/upgrades you can afford, but attempts to buy the best buildings/upgrades. If you do not see the script buying. It is waiting for the best option to become available. When the item is calculated to be available to purchase within 120 seconds, it will be added to queue for purchase.

- **AutoBuy Protect** - Calculates Lucky and Frenzy requirements so that AutoBuy doesn't go below them. If Autobuy seems "stuck" try disabling this feature.
- **Auto Fortune** - Auto click on News ticker fortunes.
- **Auto Wrinklers** - Pop the single fattest normal (excluding Shiny) wrinkler if you are at your max. This can now be customized further in the options menu to choose your Max Wrinkler count and include Shiny if needed.
- **AutoPet Krumblor** - Pets Krumblor when you reach lvl 4 to unlock Dragon drops. Krumblor's Menu must be open. Turns off if you have all 4 drops.
- **Ascend Luck** - Used for unlocking Lucky digit, Lucky number, and Lucky payout. Automatically Ascends you when conditions are met and toggles this feature to off. Turn back on manually if you have more to unlock. Does not buy the Heavenly upgrade for you.
- **Hotkeys (Keyboard Shutcuts)** - This option allows you to change settings via keyboard. Enable/Disable in the Options menu for the mod.

## Notes

- When you start the mod, all options will be Off. To enable / disable please use the Options menu - mod options are saved, so when you reload the game your previously enabled options will be enabled automatically.
- If you started a fresh save without any buildings, and want to use the AutoBuy feature. Buy one building manually and the AutoBuy feature will work. This should not be a problem anymore after the 2024-02-12 ACABM update.
- After you Ascend and buying 1 each is too slow, you can change the buy amount to 100 or 10 until buying "slows down" then change back to 1. This option is available naively above the Buildings
- This is a stand-alone mod that does not rely on CCES. If you use CCES and encounter an issue with this mod, please let me know.
